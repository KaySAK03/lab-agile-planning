As a Farmer,
I need fertilizer,
So that I can apply the fertilzer to my crops for a higher yield.

The land used for planting is not very fertile and our past harvests have been poor.

Given that Fertilizer is provided and applied,
When I harvest at the end of the farming period and the yield is bountiful,
Then my problem has been solved
